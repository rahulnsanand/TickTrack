## What does this app do?
It caters to the need to create counters, timers and stopwatch in ways that you never knew you needed. There’s also various meticulously designed widgets, for every functionality that the app provides and more. Be sure to check out all the clock faces of the Clock widget.

Oh great, another “Create 2 timers for free, pay to continue breathing with app open” application.

Um, no. The app is completely free and will be free as long as Google doesn’t decide to change the Google Drive functionalities.

Why Drive?
All your counters, timer and preferences data is safely and securely backed up into your own google account. All your data, completely yours. (Honestly, I can’t afford to store all your data on my servers, for free).

Key Features:

## Counter:

You can create a counter to keep track of things you’d like to not store in your mind. Like, how many glasses of water did you drink or how many times a person sneezed in a day. You know? Truly important things. Only, TickTrack does it all in the most minimalist, elegant manner.
You can set milestones to commemorate a special count value. Maybe celebrate the fact that you had 15 glasses of water! You can customize the counter to fit just the perfect way you need it.

## Timer:

The timer functionality of the app allows you to set multiple timers and quick timers simultaneously. Like Counters, you can also customize timers which includes naming and flags with various colors. The list of all the timers created by you gets sorted according to the timer value. If the user is in a hurry, they can use the hassle free functionality of Quicktimer. Or if you want to keep a dedicated timer for an occasion or an event. You can just create a custom timer and easily access it from the dashboard whenever required.

## Screensaver:

Unlike other screensavers, TickTrack provides a very minimalist screensaver UI with customizability when it comes to clock faces and brightness. Screensavers are best viewed on an AMOLED or higher screen as the blacks are truly your phones pixels being off. And so, your battery is saved splendidly. On LCD displays, you might use up more battery than you think.


## Stopwatch:

![Stopwatch Graphic](https://github.com/theflopguy/TickTrack/blob/master/images/Playstore-ScreenshotsArtboard-3.png)

Just your standard stopwatch to record laps, and keep track of time. Only, on TickTrack it’s the most elegantly designed stopwatch

## Widgets?

![Widgets Graphic](https://github.com/theflopguy/TickTrack/blob/master/images/Playstore-ScreenshotsArtboard-5.png)

It’s nice to see you’re still into widgets. Widgets are cool aren’t they? Well, We’ve just made them cool-er! You can create a custom Counter Widget that is linked to a counter that exists on your TickTrack app, you can create a custom Clock Widget and show off the 6 brilliantly designed clock faces for your minimalist home screen.
You can also create a TickTrack Console widget to access all TickTrack functionality from your home screen in a jiffy.

Well, that concludes the total functionality of TickTrack. Why don’t you give it a try by downloading it and using it for free and give us feedback if there’s any improvement you’d like to suggest.

## Permission Info:

Most importantly, we require the app to be kept in the “Do No Optimize” section of your Battery Optimization Settings. This is highly required and recommended as without this, most Recent Android Operating Systems TickTrack will be automatically killed in the background as it’s running a timer. This can cause you to miss your timers and dang it, we don’t want that.

Second Most Important: We want you to allow TickTrack to AutoStart. Yeah, some devices have this special feature that allows the user to turn on Auto Start feature so the app can run as soon as your phone turns on. Why is this important? Well, because without this feature. If your timer is running and your phone restarts due to any reason. It can cause you to miss timers and furthermore, it can cause bugs that will only look bad on us.
